Thank you for taking the time to read this.
I have included the Simulink .slx files as is per the simulation parameters that I was testing at the time of submission. 
Also included the MATLAB .m files that I used for generating the plots. HOWEVER please note that the MATLAB codes are very rough that I used to plot the data efficiently. 

Thanks
